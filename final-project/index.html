            <h3><b> Hobbys-</b></h3><br> 
            <p> I like to play videogames with my friends. I have a gaming computer that i built a couple summers ago with my dad. Some of the games I like to play are: Minecraft, Apex Legends, Rocket league, Call of Duty...etc. I also like to snowboard in the winter. I Love the rush from speeding down the mountain (atleast untill I wipe out). Me and my friends are all snowboarders as well as my brother and his girlfriend. i am also a big golfer in the warmer months.</p><hr>
